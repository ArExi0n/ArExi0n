# 👋 Hey, I’m Ansh

I’m a developer and builder — combining **Web Dev / App dev**, **AI**, and **Web3** to create systems that actually *work*.

### 🚀 What I’m Building
- 💹 **AI-Driven Crypto Trading App** — detects dips, predicts recoveries, and automates alerts using ML.
- 🔗 **Web3 Experiments** — smart trading logic, wallet integrations, and on-chain analytics.
- ⚙️ **Automation Projects** — building connections between APIs, data, and human decisions.

### 💻 Dev Side
- **Web / Web3 Developer** — from clean UIs to on-chain logic.
- **Vim & Neovim Power User** — deep into Lua configs, keymaps, plugins, and optimization.
- Write mostly in **Rust**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**.

### 🧠 Entrepreneur Side
- I build like a startup — fast iterations, minimal fluff, real impact.
- Focused on **system design**, **product thinking**, and **execution**.
- Always mixing code with strategy — not just features, but direction.

### 🌱 Learning & Exploring
- Advanced AI integration into real apps  
- Web3 + trading infrastructure  
- Building long-term systems that scale without noise

### 🛠️ Current Stack
